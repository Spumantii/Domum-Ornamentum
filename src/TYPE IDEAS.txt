NEW TYPES

    POST (baluster)
    places like a panel (sideways possible), looks like a single fence post, doesn't have joining states.
    Swaps out the panel collision for one of 3 shapes based on facing direction.
    -plain
    -turned
    -heavy
    -pinched
    -double (two posts side by side for tiling repetition, maybe swaps out a third collision option that's a little wider)

    DO LADDER
    Inherits all the behaviours of ladders but has a DO swapped model asset with one that allows 1 or 2 picked materials

    PILASTER
    "An upright architectural member that is rectangular in plan and is architecturally treated as a column, that usually
    projects a third of its width or less from the wall"
    (this is a cross between a pillar and a panel, a flat (3 thick) geometry that looks like a pillar but placed against facade,
    to appear submerged.  the behaviour of states exactly as in the pillar types, except in the shape profile of a panel, placed
    against a surface)
    (3 assets per any type based on existing pillars)
    -square pilaster
    -round pilaster
